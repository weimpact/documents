* We need content in local language, so it's useful for everyone (should be helpful than rumors)
* Should have %age along with numbers (coz population is not considered)
* FAQ / Myths (with science backed links / vids)
* Emergency Contact Information (Aggregate)
    - helplines
    - hospitals
    - report (do we even have this?)
        * could build this
* list of good videos (about covid, how it spreads) like a wiki
* possible to do remote meetup with experts?
* numbers are available in other sites, we should have daily increase in comparison with other countries
* on ed, since folks aren't serious we should have some content about other countries where it's critical/panic
